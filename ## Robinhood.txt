# Introduction
Robinhood Market Inc. is an American born investment platform that offers free trading for everyone. It is located in Menlo Park California. Robinhood was founded in April, 2013 by Second generation from India, Baiju Bhatt and Bulgarian-born Vlad Tenev who were roommate and graduate from Stanford. 
After graduation, both founders moved to NYC and built two finance companies, selling trading software to hedge funds. They soon learned that large wall Street firms paid effectively nothing to trade stocks, while charging consumers commission for every trade they made. Soon after, Baiju and Vlad decided that it was important to build products that would enable financial trading platform access to every consumer allow them to participate in their financial system with affordable subscription. 
The name Robinhood derived from it’s mission “to provide everyone with access to the financial market, not just the wealthy”. By March 2015, they publicly showcased their App at LA Hacks and launched the App for consumers to use.  Robinhood is design for enabling people to invest in stocks, ETFs, cryptocurrencies and   option through Robinhood Financial and crypto trading through Robinhood Crypto using mobile app or website with minimal monthly subscription of $6. 
It is compatible with iPhone, Apple Watch, and Android. Moreover, it gives investors access to margin trading. Additionally, the firm plans on diving in to checking and savings market with new cash management program in near future. Robinhood is a FINRA regulated broker dealer that holds registration with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and member of Security Investor Protection Corporation. 
# Funding
Robinhood’s main funding comes from interest earned on consumer’s cash balances, selling order information to high frequency traders and margin lending. Currently it has more than 13 million users. Robinhood raised $110 million at a $1.3 billion valuation led by Yuri Milner of DST Global, Venture Capitalist, physicist and entrepreneur who is Russia’s most influential IT tech investor along with Greenoaks Capital and Thrive Capital.

Within a year they announced their expansion in UK with additional funding from Bloomberg and other outlets. Recently, in May 2020, they has raised another $280 million in venture funding with valuation of $8.3 billion led by sequoia Capital. 
 According to  Techchurch article published by Alex Wilhelm on August 17, 2020, Robinhood was valued at 11.2 billion as its revenue scaled and raised another $200 million. The funding was led by D1 partners and a privet capital pool that was founded in 2018. According to CNBC reports, Robinhood make majority of their money from option trading. 
 They attract the highest rate of any firm for equity trades and gained the greatest quarter over quter increase in payment for order flow of any e-brokers. 
# Technologies used 
Robinhood uses AWS (Amazon Web Services) to operate its online business, deliver and update its mobile trading app, trading data, securely store consumer information, and perform business analytics. With AWS they use 18 different services including security, permissions, scaling and monitoring. Robinhood only employed two DevOps people who overseas AWS to create a large scalable securities trading app with fine built-in security and compliance features that supported thousands of users at launch. AWS helps them control data stream while allowing to share throughout their platform. Additionally, Robinhood utilizes Redshift feature provided by amazon to look at real time analytics and user behaviors. 
Robinhood made financial trading a reality for many millennials who are the biggest risk takers, just starting to explore trade investments and are looking for free platform to invest and rather than paying commission to large trading organizations. they have initiated use of technology to roll out red carpet to financial services to previously underserved sector of the population.   Robinhood offers low fees and zero balance to open new account to attract new investors. Consumers would have to purchase $6 monthly subscription to access Robinhood gold to gain access trade on margin, view market depth data, and access research like Morningstar reports on high volume stocks. However, they can try it for 30 days for free. Although, they do not publish their trading statistics the way other brokers do, hence becomes difficult to compare their payment for order flow statistics to anyone else.  Since Coronavirus downturn, retail trading has been growing at exceptionally fast pace. Currently, Robinhood has more than 3 million accounts despite of uncertain economy. 
Robinhood is a pioneer of free trading platform since more than five years. Their competitors such as E*trades, TD Ameritrade, Vanguard, Interactive Brokers, and Charles Schwab felt pressure to offer free trading platform to retain their clients. Robinhood is exemplary in the FinTech space because it offers commission-free trades of stocks and exchange-traded funds. They also offer trading of cryptocurrencies. Robinhood has a slick, user-friendly interface and is available on mobile platforms making it widely available and very accessible.
Despite of all Robinhood’s strengths, it still has a few weaknesses. Being one of the pioneers in commission-free trading, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that they have faced a few difficulties. Robinhood pushes Option to their consumers which retains conflict of interest.  Robinhood has limited stock trading of 5000 stocks and cap of $2500 withdrawal cap regardless of how much money you got in your account. Moreover, their clients are young inexperience consumer base that often loose money due to lack of education in the trading industry. In my opinion, if Robinhood educate their consumer base would be beneficial for the organization. 

Robinhood will potentially have much pressure to expand too fast and if they’re not ready to take them to next level, it can hurt the company. As the competitors are providing same platform, it’ll become competitive for Robinhood to continue stand out. In my opinion, they need to up their game by offering wide verity of investment choices like mutual funds and bonds. Have a reliable server for the app to avoid incident like server down for whole day. Add different account type such as checking and saving while increasing daily withdrawal limit.  Make it easier for people to access and mange account holding including being able to transfer money to their banks or printing statements and tax documents etc. Perhaps they can use blockchain technology and increase their cryptocurrency to achieve their goal.  In addition, Robinhood should definitely educate their consumer base. I believe that having more flexibility would give them the edge they need to sustain in the competitor market. Having educated consumer will gain stock market share and utilize other services which would prove profitable to the firm.
